# School_District_Analysis
In this Module 4 we are developing Data analytics project using Python 3.7.6 , Jupyter &amp; Pandas

How is the district summary affected?
In PyCitySchools_Challenge_District_Summary case the % passing math and reading is decreased with few decimals 


How does removing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?
Thomas High School’s performance cannot be rated with other schools since the 9th grade math and reading scores are Nan. All scores for all subjects and grades are needed to make a fair comparison.


 How does removing the ninth-grade scores affect the Math and Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type? 
By Grade - Since 9th grade score is missing there is no indication of how the students performed. This is a huge problem.
Scores by School Spending = Same at 638 for both
Scores by School size = reading and math scores have decreased in the challenger case. 
Scores by School Type = Reading and Math passing has increased in the Challenge case.


How is the school summary affected?
In School_summary the avaerage math score is increased compare to the other challenge case.But on the other hand the average reading score is higher in PyCitySchools_Challenge.Also % passing math and % passing reading  is increased the Per School Summary.
